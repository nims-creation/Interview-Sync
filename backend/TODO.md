# Backend Development TODO for Interview Scheduling Platform

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Create backend directory structure: `Interview-Dashboard/backend/` with src/, prisma/, etc.
- [ ] Set up package.json with modern dependencies (express, typescript, prisma, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, nodemailer, cors, helmet, express-rate-limit, etc.)
- [ ] Configure TypeScript (tsconfig.json) with strict settings
- [ ] Add .env file for secrets (DB URL, JWT secret, email creds)
- [ ] Add .gitignore for node_modules, .env, etc.

## 2. Database Setup
- [ ] Set up Prisma schema for User, Interview, Slot models with proper relations
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL connection
- [ ] Run Prisma migrations

## 3. Server Foundation
- [ ] Implement Express server with modern middleware (CORS, JSON parsing, helmet for security, rate limiting)
- [ ] Add error handling middleware for all types of errors (validation, auth, server errors)
- [ ] Set up logging with winston or similar for production monitoring
- [ ] Configure graceful shutdown

## 4. Authentication System
- [ ] Create JWT and role-based middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Implement auth routes: /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/logout with input validation
- [ ] Add password hashing with bcrypt and salt rounds
- [ ] Implement refresh token mechanism for better security

## 5. API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement CRUD APIs for interviews with proper validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement CRUD APIs for slots with conflict checking
- [ ] Add pagination and filtering for large datasets
- [ ] Implement proper HTTP status codes and response formats

## 6. Notifications & Integrations
- [ ] Integrate Nodemailer for email notifications (bookings, reminders, cancellations)
- [ ] Add email templates for professional notifications
- [ ] Prepare placeholders for Google Calendar API integration
- [ ] Prepare placeholders for video link generation (Zoom/Jitsi)

## 7. Security & Performance
- [ ] Implement input sanitization and validation with Joi or similar
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Implement caching with Redis (optional for scalability)
- [ ] Add request compression
- [ ] Ensure all endpoints handle load and are optimized

## 8. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update AuthContext.tsx to call backend APIs instead of mocks
- [ ] Add proper error handling in frontend for API responses
- [ ] Update API base URLs in frontend

## 9. Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Add unit tests for controllers and middleware
- [ ] Add integration tests for APIs
- [ ] Add load testing scripts
- [ ] Prepare Docker setup for containerization
- [ ] Update README with backend setup and full-stack instructions

## 10. Final Touches
- [ ] Test end-to-end: register, login, book interview, notifications
- [ ] Ensure all error types are handled gracefully (network, validation, auth, server)
- [ ] Optimize for production (minify, compress, etc.)
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging for production
