# Interview Scheduling Platform - Fixed Issues

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Environment Configuration
**Problem**: No `.env` file was present, causing runtime errors when trying to access environment variables.

**Solution**: Created `.env` file with all required environment variables:
- Database configuration (MongoDB URI)
- JWT secret and expiration
- Server configuration (PORT, NODE_ENV, FRONTEND_URL)
- Rate limiting settings
- Email configuration (optional)
- Logging configuration

### 2. Role Case Mismatch Between Frontend and Backend
**Problem**: 
- Backend used uppercase roles (`CANDIDATE`, `INTERVIEWER`, `ADMIN`)
- Frontend expected lowercase roles (`candidate`, `interviewer`, `admin`)
- This caused authentication and authorization failures

**Solution**: 
- Updated backend to normalize roles to uppercase for storage
- Modified API responses to return lowercase roles for frontend compatibility
- Updated all middleware and controllers to handle lowercase role comparisons
- Fixed role validation in registration to accept both cases

### 3. Missing API Endpoints
**Problem**: Frontend was calling API endpoints that didn't exist:
- `PATCH /api/interviews/:id/cancel` for cancelling interviews

**Solution**: 
- Added `cancelInterview` controller function
- Added corresponding route in interviews router
- Implemented proper permission checks and slot availability management

### 4. Data Structure Mismatches
**Problem**: Frontend expected different data structures than what backend provided.

**Solution**: 
- Updated API responses to match frontend expectations
- Fixed data mapping in controllers
- Ensured consistent data formats across all endpoints

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - The `.env` file has been created with default values
   - Update the `JWT_SECRET` with a secure random string
   - Update `MONGODB_URI` if using a different MongoDB instance
   - Configure email settings if you want email notifications

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running on your system
   - The application will connect to `mongodb://localhost:27017/interview_scheduling`

4. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   
   For development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd project
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build and Run**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout user
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile

### Interviews
- `GET /api/interviews` - Get user's interviews
- `POST /api/interviews` - Create new interview (candidates only)
- `GET /api/interviews/:id` - Get specific interview
- `PUT /api/interviews/:id` - Update interview (interviewers/admins only)
- `PATCH /api/interviews/:id/cancel` - Cancel interview
- `DELETE /api/interviews/:id` - Delete interview (interviewers/admins only)

### Slots
- `GET /api/slots` - Get available slots
- `POST /api/slots` - Create new slot (interviewers/admins only)
- `GET /api/slots/:id` - Get specific slot
- `PUT /api/slots/:id` - Update slot (interviewers/admins only)
- `DELETE /api/slots/:id` - Delete slot (interviewers/admins only)

## User Roles

- **candidate**: Can book interviews and view their own interviews
- **interviewer**: Can manage availability slots and view their interviews
- **admin**: Full access to all features

## Key Features Fixed

1. **Authentication System**: Proper JWT token handling with role-based access
2. **Interview Scheduling**: Complete CRUD operations for interviews
3. **Slot Management**: Availability management for interviewers
4. **Role-based Permissions**: Proper access control based on user roles
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
6. **Data Validation**: Input validation using Joi schemas
7. **Database Integration**: Proper MongoDB integration with Mongoose

## Testing the Application

1. Start the backend server: `npm run dev` (in backend directory)
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev` (in project directory)
3. Register users with different roles (candidate, interviewer)
4. Login and test the different dashboards
5. Create availability slots as an interviewer
6. Book interviews as a candidate
7. Test the various CRUD operations

## Notes

- The application now properly handles role case differences between frontend and backend
- All API endpoints are properly secured with authentication and authorization
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- The codebase follows TypeScript best practices
- All builds pass without errors
